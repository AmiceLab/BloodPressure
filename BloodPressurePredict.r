# This project amis to predict Blood Pressure without medical device. 

# Nearly half of adults in the United States (108 million, or 45%) have hypertension (also called high blood pressure (HBP)) (ie., systolic blood pressure â‰¥ 130 mm Hg). 
# Blood Pressure is an important indicator for predicting health.
# Long-term high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, heart disease, heart failure, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia.

# To keep track a peron blood pressure, blood pressure guage can be used. However, it required professionals assistance, and most people may not have a blood pressure guage on hands.
# Some people do not even know that they have high blood pressure issue.
# Have a blood pressure AI algorithms to instantly estimated their blood pressure with simple parameters, such age, BMI, Hours of Sleep, etc. could provide an early alert and attention on their health. If there is double, they should go for a proper checkup and medical follow-up.

# Multiple regression generally explains the relationship between multiple independent or predictor variables and one dependent or criterion variable. ... The multiple regression equation explained above takes the following form:

# y = b1 x Age + b2 x BMI + .. + b5 x AlcoholDay + c   

# Multiple Linear Regression
# The purpose of a multiple linear regression is to:

# 2.Determine the signficance or insignificance of each feature.

#Sequential Model

#----------------------

# Initialize a sequential model: The first step is to initialize a sequential model with keras_model_sequential(), which is the beginning of our Keras model. The sequential model is composed of a linear stack of layers.

# Apply layers to the sequential model: Layers consist of the input layer, hidden layers and an output layer. 

# The input layer is the data and provided itâ€™s formatted correctly thereâ€™s nothing more to discuss. The hidden layers and output layers are what controls the ANN inner workings.

# Hidden Layers: Hidden layers form the neural network nodes that enable non-linear activation using weights. The hidden layers are created using layer_dense(). Weâ€™ll add two hidden layers. Weâ€™ll apply units = 16, which is the number of nodes. Weâ€™ll select kernel_initializer = "uniform" and activation = "relu" for both layers. The first layer needs to have the input_shape = 35, which is the number of columns in the training set. Key Point: While we are arbitrarily selecting the number of hidden layers, units, kernel initializers and activation functions, these parameters can be optimized through a process called hyperparameter tuning that is discussed in Next Steps.

#-----------------------


# Input layer: Number of Features + 1
# Hidden layer : Training Data Samples/(Factor * (Input Neurons + Output Neurons))
# Output layer: 1

# A factor of Scaling Factor is set in this case, the purpose of the factor being to prevent overfitting. 
# A factor can take a value between 5 and 10. With 4 neurons in the input layer, 
# 1 neuron in the output layer and ~1000 observations in the training set, 
# the hidden layer is assigned 1000/((5 TO 10) *(4+1)) =  neurons. (20-40)

# Weâ€™re using RMSprop as our optimizer here. RMSprop stands for Root Mean Square Propagation. 
# Itâ€™s one of the most popular gradient descent optimization algorithms for deep learning networks. 
# RMSprop is an optimizer thatâ€™s reliable and fast.

# Adam realizes the benefits of both AdaGrad and RMSProp.
# Instead of adapting the parameter learning rates based on the average first moment (the mean) as in RMSProp, Adam also makes use of the average of the second moments of the gradients (the uncentered variance).

# Optimizing MSE is same as optimizing RMSE
model %>% compile(
  loss = 'mean_squared_error',  #mean_absolute_error, #mean_squared_error  #mean_squared_logarithmic_error
  optimizer = 'adam',  #adam  #RMSprop #sgd
  metrics = c('mse')  #Mean Absolute Error (MAE) #mea
)

#mean_squared_error converge faster in episode 7, also suitable for target value having outliners

#We can see that the model converged reasonably quickly and both train and test performance remained equivalent. The performance and convergence behavior of the model suggest that mean squared error is a good match for a neural network learning this problem.

#We use the fit() function to run the ANN on our training data. The object is our model, and x and y are our training data in matrix and numeric vector forms, respectively. The batch_size = 50 sets the number samples per gradient update within each epoch. We set epochs = 35 to control the number training cycles. Typically we want to keep the batch size high since this decreases the error within each training cycle (epoch). We also want epochs to be large, which is important in visualizing the training history (discussed below). We set validation_split = 0.30 to include 30% of the data for model validation, which prevents overfitting. The training process should complete in 15 seconds or so.
